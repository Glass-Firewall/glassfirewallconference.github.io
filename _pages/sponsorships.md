As part of our mission to lower the barrier of entry into cybersecurity, we aim to continually ensure that this conference is free for attendees. In recent years, trainings such as conference participation or certifications have become a norm for people in the industry to boost their skills, however, these conferences and certifications typically come with an expensive price tag, becoming cost prohibitive for many talented individuals. 

If you would like to get involved, and help inspire and cultivate the newer generations of women in cybersecurity, please contact us!
